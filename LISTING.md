## Short Description (200 chars)
DealPilot adds AI-powered deal analysis to your Breeze agent. Get win probability scores, risk signals, smart follow-up emails, and prioritized next steps — all from a single conversation.

## Long Description
DealPilot is an AI-powered deal intelligence suite that works as Breeze agent tools inside HubSpot. Instead of manually reviewing deal records and guessing what to do next, simply ask your Breeze agent to analyze any deal.

### What DealPilot does:

**📊 Analyze Deal Health**
Get an instant win probability score (0-100) based on deal stage, amount, close date proximity, last contact recency, and data completeness. DealPilot identifies specific risk signals like stale deals, missing decision makers, overdue close dates, and unengaged contacts.

**✉️ Draft Follow-Up Emails**
Generate personalized follow-up emails using AI. DealPilot pulls deal and contact context, then crafts a professional email with the right tone, specific deal references, and a clear call-to-action. Choose from professional, friendly, or urgent tones.

**⚡ Create Smart Next Steps**
Get three prioritized, time-bound action items tailored to your deal's current state. DealPilot automatically creates a HubSpot task assigned to the deal owner with the most important next action.

### How it works:
1. Install DealPilot from the HubSpot Marketplace
2. Add DealPilot tools to your Breeze agent
3. Ask your agent: "Analyze the Acme Corp deal" or "Draft a follow-up for deal 12345"
4. Get instant, actionable intelligence

### Why DealPilot:
- **No manual analysis** — AI scores and assesses every deal in seconds
- **Context-aware emails** — follow-ups reference real deal data, not generic templates  
- **Actionable next steps** — not vague advice, but specific time-bound tasks
- **Native HubSpot** — works inside Breeze, no context switching
- **Tasks auto-created** — next steps become real HubSpot tasks automatically
